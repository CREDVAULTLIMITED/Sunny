  - **css/**: Stylesheets
  - **js/**: Client-side JavaScript
  - **images/**: Image assets

- **deployment/**: Deployment configurations
  - **kubernetes/**: Kubernetes manifests
  - **terraform/**: Infrastructure as code

- **docs/**: Documentation files

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- **ES6+ Features**: The codebase uses modern JavaScript features including arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, and classes.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in the admin dashboard and critical components for type safety.
- **JSDoc Comments**: All functions and classes have JSDoc comments for better documentation.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes and messages.
- **Async Patterns**: Consistent use of async/await for asynchronous operations.

### React Components

- **Functional Components**: React components are primarily functional with hooks.
- **Component Organization**: Components are organized by feature and reusability.
- **Props Validation**: PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for props validation.
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic is extracted into custom hooks.

### CSS/Styling

- **CSS Organization**: CSS files are organized by component or feature.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints.
- **CSS Variables**: Use of CSS variables for consistent theming.
- **BEM Methodology**: BEM naming convention for CSS classes.

### Go Code

- **Package Structure**: Clear package structure with separation of concerns.
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns.
- **Context Usage**: Proper use of context for request handling.
- **Middleware Pattern**: Modular middleware for cross-cutting concerns.

### Rust Code

- **Module Organization**: Well-organized modules with clear responsibilities.
- **Error Handling**: Use of Result and Option types for error handling.
- **Memory Safety**: Careful management of ownership and borrowing.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all public APIs.

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing.
- **Output Encoding**: Data is properly encoded before output to prevent XSS.
- **Authentication**: Robust authentication mechanisms with JWT.
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained authorization checks.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Encryption and tokenization for sensitive data.
- **Dependency Security**: Regular scanning of dependencies for vulnerabilities.

### Performance

- **Lazy Loading**: Components and routes are lazy-loaded when appropriate.
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized React rendering with proper key usage.
- **Caching**: Strategic caching of API responses and computed values.
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting and tree shaking for smaller bundles.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for business logic.
- **Integration Tests**: API and component integration tests.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user flows are tested end-to-end.
- **Test Coverage**: High test coverage for critical components.
- **Mocking**: Proper mocking of external dependencies.

### Documentation

- **Code Comments**: Clear and concise comments for complex logic.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation with examples.
- **Architecture Documentation**: High-level architecture documentation.
- **README Files**: Each major component has its own README.

## Code Quality Tools

The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint**: For JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier**: For code formatting
- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking
- **Husky**: For pre-commit hooks
- **SonarQube**: For code quality analysis
- **Dependabot**: For dependency updates

## Continuous Integration

The CI pipeline includes:

- **Automated Testing**: All tests are run on each pull request
- **Code Quality Checks**: Linting and formatting checks
- **Security Scanning**: Dependency and code security scanning
- **Build Verification**: Ensuring the project builds correctly
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Critical performance metrics are tracked

## Areas for Improvement

While the codebase maintains high quality standards, there are areas that could be improved:

1. **Test Coverage**: Some newer components have lower test coverage
2. **Documentation**: Some internal APIs could use more detailed documentation
3. **TypeScript Migration**: Complete the migration of JavaScript files to TypeScript
4. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimization of rendering performance in complex dashboard views
5. **Accessibility**: Enhance accessibility compliance across all UI components

## Contributing Guidelines

When contributing to the codebase:

1. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Maintain consistency with the existing code style
2. **Write Tests**: Include tests for new functionality
3. **Document Changes**: Update documentation to reflect changes
4. **Review Code**: Perform self-review before submitting pull requests
5. **Consider Performance**: Be mindful of performance implications
6. **Security First**: Always consider security implications of changes

## Conclusion

The Sunny Payment Gateway codebase is well-structured, follows modern best practices, and maintains high quality standards. By following the guidelines in this document, contributors can help maintain and improve the code quality as the project evolves.
