## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
```bash
# 1. Ensure Docker is installed
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# 2. Verify environment configuration
node scripts/production-setup.js

# 3. Run security audit
node scripts/run-security-test.js
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production
node scripts/deploy-production.js

# Verify deployment
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/status
```

### Post-Deployment Verification
- ✅ Health endpoints responding
- ✅ Security headers present
- ⚠️ Payment processors need production credentials
- ⚠️ SSL certificates need to be configured

## 📋 Current Status

**Overall Readiness: 60%**

- **Security**: 85% complete
- **Infrastructure**: 90% complete  
- **Payment Integration**: 30% complete (needs production credentials)
- **Monitoring**: 40% complete
- **Compliance**: 20% complete

## 📞 Next Steps
