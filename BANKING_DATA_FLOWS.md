# Sunny Payment Gateway - Banking Data Flows

## Introduction

This document details the secure data flow architecture implemented within the Sunny Payment Gateway, specifically focusing on the banking integration components. It describes how transaction data moves through the system, security measures at each step, and isolation mechanisms that protect sensitive financial information.

The architecture follows financial industry best practices and is designed to meet PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and banking regulatory requirements.

## 1. Network Zones and Segmentation

### 1.1 Zone Architecture

Sunny Payment Gateway implements a strict network segmentation model with isolated zones:

| Zone | Purpose | Access Level | Traffic Type |
|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Public Zone** | External-facing APIs and web interfaces | Least restricted | Client requests, webhooks |
| **Processing Zone** | Payment orchestration and processing | Moderately restricted | Sanitized payment requests, fraud checks |
| **Banking Zone** | Banking connections and integrations | Highly restricted | Tokenized payment commands, financial data |
| **Database Zone** | Data storage | Highly restricted | Encrypted persistent data |
| **HSM Zone** | Cryptographic operations | Most restricted | Key operations, signing requests |
| **Admin Zone** | Administrative functions | Restricted with MFA | Management operations |

### 1.2 Zone Isolation Implementation

Zone isolation is implemented through:

- Physical network segmentation (in production)
- VLAN isolation with strict ACLs
- Stateful firewalls between all zones
- Encrypted tunnels for all cross-zone communication
- Jump servers for administrative access
- Network monitoring at zone boundaries

## 2. End-to-End Payment Processing Flows

### 2.1 Card Payment Flow

```
[Client] → [Public Zone: API Gateway]
  ↓ TLS 1.3 + OAuth2
[Processing Zone: Payment Orchestrator]
  ↓ Field-level encryption + Mutual TLS
[Processing Zone: Fraud Detection]
  ↓ Service mesh encryption
[Processing Zone: Card Processor]
  ↓ TLS 1.3 with PFS + Mutual TLS
[Banking Zone: Banking Interface]
  ↓ TLS 1.3 with PFS + Client Certificate
[Banking Partner: Card Network]
```

### 2.2 Bank Transfer Flow

```
[Client] → [Public Zone: API Gateway]
  ↓ TLS 1.3 + OAuth2
[Processing Zone: Payment Orchestrator]
  ↓ Field-level encryption + Mutual TLS
[Processing Zone: Fraud Detection]
  ↓ Service mesh encryption
[Processing Zone: Bank Transfer Processor]
  ↓ TLS 1.3 with PFS + Mutual TLS
[Banking Zone: Banking Interface]
  ↓ TLS 1.3 with PFS + Client Certificate
[Banking Partner: ACH/SEPA/Wire Network]
```

### 2.3 Payment Status Check Flow

```
[Client] → [Public Zone: API Gateway]
  ↓ TLS 1.3 + OAuth2
[Processing Zone: Payment Orchestrator]
  ↓ Service mesh encryption
[Database Zone: Transaction Storage]
  ↓ Encrypted storage
[Processing Zone: Payment Orchestrator]
  ↓ If status update needed
[Banking Zone: Banking Interface]
  ↓ TLS 1.3 with PFS + Client Certificate
[Banking Partner: Status API]
```

### 2.4 Settlement Flow

```
[Scheduled Job] → [Admin Zone: Settlement Engine]
  ↓ Service mesh encryption + MFA
[Database Zone: Transaction Storage]
  ↓ Encrypted read with service account
[Processing Zone: Settlement Processor]
  ↓ TLS 1.3 with PFS + Mutual TLS
[Banking Zone: Banking Interface]
  ↓ TLS 1.3 with PFS + Client Certificate
[Banking Partner: Settlement API]
```

## 3. Data Isolation and Protection

### 3.1 Data Classification

| Data Category | Sensitivity | Encryption | Storage Zone | Retention |
|---------------|------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| Card Numbers (PAN) | Highest | Field-level encryption + HSM | Not stored (tokenized) | N/A |
| Card Security Codes (CVV) | Highest | In-memory only, HSM encryption | Not stored | N/A |
| Bank Account Numbers | Highest | Field-level encryption + HSM | Tokenized in Database Zone | Per regulations |
| Customer PII | High | Field-level encryption | Database Zone | Per regulations |
| Transaction Metadata | Medium | Encryption at rest | Database Zone | 7 years |
| Authentication Tokens | High | HSM-based encryption | In-memory/Database Zone | Short-lived |
| API Keys | High | HSM-based encryption | Database Zone | Until rotated |
| Transaction Logs | Medium | Encryption at rest | Database Zone | 7 years |

### 3.2 Tokenization Strategy

For sensitive payment information:

1. Raw payment data received in Processing Zone
2. Immediately tokenized using HSM in HSM Zone
3. Original data discarded from memory as soon as possible
4. Only tokens stored in Database Zone
5. De-tokenization requires Banking Zone access + HSM approval

### 3.3 Encryption Key Management

- Multi-layered key hierarchy
- Master keys managed in HSM Zone
- Data encryption keys rotated every 90 days
- Banking integration keys rotated every 30 days
- Key ceremonies documented and audited
- Split knowledge/dual control for critical keys

## 4. Secure Communication Channels

### 4.1 Inter-Zone Communication

| Source Zone | Destination Zone | Protocol | Authentication | Encryption | Additional Controls |
|-------------|------------------|----------|----------------|------------|---------------------|
| Public | Processing | HTTPS | OAuth2 + API Key | TLS 1.3 | WAF, Rate Limiting |
| Processing | Banking | HTTPS | Mutual TLS | TLS 1.3 with PFS | IP Whitelisting, Request Signing |
| Processing | Database | TDS/Postgres/MySQL | Service Account | TLS 1.3 + Column Encryption | Query Filtering |
| Processing | HSM | PKCS#11 | Mutual TLS + Key | TLS 1.3 with PFS | IP Whitelisting |
| Banking | External Bank | HTTPS/SFTP | Mutual TLS/PKI | TLS 1.3 with PFS | Message Signing |
| Admin | Any | HTTPS | MFA + Role-Based | TLS 1.3 with PFS | Session Monitoring, Audit Logging |

### 4.2 External Communication

All external communications implement:

- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- Strong cipher suites (TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)
- Certificate pinning for banking connections
- OCSP stapling
- SNI validation
- Extended validation certificates
- Mutual TLS where supported

### 4.3 API Security

- All endpoints require authentication
- Banking APIs require additional authorization
- Signed requests with replay protection
- Request idempotency for payment operations
- Input validation at API gateway layer
- Structured logging of all API calls
